SSH Keys/Keypairs/NA,Global(Project),Regional(EC2),No such service,"In AWS you can create your own RSA key pair and upload it to the region in which you want to use it; therefore, you can make your key pair globally available by uploading it to each region."
,,Global(RSA),,"In GCP, you can block the project-wide Keys and use the specific keypairs for single instance."
Cloud KMS/ KMS /,Global,Regional,Global,"GCP Keys belong to a region, but are not constrained to that region."
,Regional,,,AWS KMS keys cannot be exported and imported across regions. Contents of Azure Key Vault can be replicated within a region and to a secondary region.æ

Network Load balancer|Internal Load balancer/ELB,Regional,Regional,Standard: Cross-Zone,AWS load balancing services can be used both internally and externally. 
,,,Basic:Zonal,GCP services are separated between external access and internal access. GCP's internal option is Internal Load Balancing.
HTTP Load balancer/ALB/ application gatewayæ,Global,Regional,Regional,The cross region region supplied in AWS route53 is available in GCP HTTP Load Balancer. Route53 is global.
Route table,Global,Route table: Regional | Cross-region,Regional,"Most of GCP networking entity in GCP such as load balancers, firewall rules and routing table have global scope."

Firewall/ SG|NACL/ NSG,Global,Regional,Regional,"æIn AWS, A security group is tied to a region and can be assigned only to instances in the same region. GCP firewall."
,,,,Azure NSG and Google Firewall are stateful and combine the function of AWS SGs and NACL.
,,,,Only 1 NSG can be applied to a NIC.
Subnet,Regional,Zonal,Regional,AWS subnet can either be public or private. EC2 in default VPC is assigned a public address.

Snapshot/ EBS Snapshot/,Global,Regional,Regional,Snapshot is global in GCP. But it is attached to a region. Copy across region will be extra cost.
,,Cross-region replication,Cross-region replication,"Amazon EBS volume is tied to its Availability Zone, redundant within a single Availability Zone and can be attached only to instances in the same Availability Zone."
,,,,Azure zone-redundant snapshots are backed byæzone-redundant storageæthat replicates your data across multiple zones.
